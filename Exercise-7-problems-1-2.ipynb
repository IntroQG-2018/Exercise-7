    "This exercise is part 2 of the exercises on thermochronology.\n",

    "The interpretation entails determining long-term average rock exhumation rates from rock samples analyzed using apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He, and muscovite <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar thermochronology.\n",
    "As you will recall, [our exercise last week](https://github.com/IntroQG-2018/Exercise-6) used a 1-D time-dependent solution to the advection-diffusion equation to calculate a temperature-depth profile in the Earth, which was then used to predict thermochronometer ages based on Dodson's method.\n",
    "In that model we specified a rock advection velocity and observed variations in the thermochronometer ages as a function of this  velocity, also known as the exhumation rate.\n",
    "This week we will compare those predicted thermochronometer ages to data from Bhutan with the goal of minimizing the misfit between the measured and predicted thermochronometer ages by varying the specified rock advection velocity (exhumation rate), which will allow us to define a best-fit exhumation rate (or exhumation history) for the Himalaya of Bhutan.\n",
    "For this exercise, we will be using data from [Coutand et al., 2014](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013JB010891) and [St√ºwe and Foster, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367912000000183) (PDFs available on the [main course page](https://introqg.github.io/qg/final-paper/articles.html))."

    "For this part you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the first *four* Python cells below.\n",
    "- Edit the cell containing the `age_predict` function to do the following things from [Exercise 6](https://github.com/IntroQG-2018/Exercise-6):\n",
    "    - Add axis labels and a title to the plot it produces.\n",
    "    - Add the advection velocity to your the plot using the `plt.text()` function.\n",
    "    - Display the predicted apatite (U-Th)/He, zircon (U-Th)/He, and muscovite $^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar ages and predicted closure temperatures on the plot using the `plt.text()` function.\n",
    "        - As before, I suggest that you use the text plotting function near the bottom of the `age_predict` function where the predicted ages are printed to the screen (if requested).\n",
    "- Run the Python cell containing the `age_predict` function to store the updated version in memory.\n",
    "- Call the `age_predict` function with calculation of the all three thermochronometer ages enabled.\n",
    "    - As before, look at the definition of `age_predict` to see how to set the flags (`True`/`False` parameters) that allow you to enable the calculation of different thermochronometers.\n",
    "    - This should reproduce Figure 9 from Exercise 6.\n",
    "- Add a figure caption for the plot in the cell beneath it describing it as if it were in a scientific journal article."
