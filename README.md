# Exercise 7: Quantitative thermochronology, part II

This exercise is part 2 of the exercises on thermochronology.
In this exercise you will modify this notebook to load [a data file of measured thermochronometer ages](data/Bhutan_age_data.txt), compare the measured ages to predicted ages from your Python code using a goodness-of-fit equation, and plot the results.
The goal is to try to minimize the misfit between the predicted and measured thermochronometer ages, and quantify the long-term exhumation rates in the Bhutan Himalaya from different thermochronometers.

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook, and then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where you are asked.
Don't forget to include clear comments that explain what happens in each section of your code cells.

- **Exercise 7 is due by 12:00 on Monday 17.12.**
- Don't forget to check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg.github.io/qg/lessons/L7/exercise-7.html) if you're having trouble.
- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points.
